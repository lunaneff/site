Hello there!

I'm Luna, and I'm:

- Swiss
- Trans
- FOSS, right to repair, and privacy advocate
- A hacker (not in the sense portrayed in movies; I just make my own devices run stuff they weren't meant to run)
- Anti-capitalist
- Anti intellectual property
- An archivist (7.1 TB as of writing)

## Stuff I like

- Gaming
- Programming
- Reading
- "That gay shitâ„¢" (lesbian visual novels)
- Dark mode (although I made this site work for those light mode weirdos too)
